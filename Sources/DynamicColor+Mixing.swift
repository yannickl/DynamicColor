   Mixes the given color object with the receiver.

   - Parameter color: A color object to mix with the receiver.
   - Parameter weight: The weight specifies the amount of the given color object (between 0 and 1). 
       The default value is 0.5, which means that half the given color and half the receiver color object should be used. 
       0.25 means that a quarter of the given color object and three quarters of the receiver color object should be used.
   - Parameter colorspace: The color space used to mix the colors. By default it uses the RBG color space.
   - Returns: A color object corresponding to the two colors object mixed together.
